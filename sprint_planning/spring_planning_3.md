## What you did

I was in the midsts of creating a new ViewController to edit the Sets, Reps, and Weight for the exercises, when, for some reason, there was an error with recognizing “import Firebase Database” as a module, so I tried reinstalling the pods, reinstalling firebase, reinstalling xcode, but nothing doing. Luckily, my teammates were able to pick up my task.

## What you plan to do:
Since my teammates have a better handle on the code base and want to include some last minute implementation, I will take care of planning the 5-minute pitch presentation for class. The process will consist of:
1. Outlining
2. Assign Roles
3. Practice
4. Timing
5. Practice

## Blockers:

I still need to try and fix my Xcode so to recognize the Firebase Database Module
